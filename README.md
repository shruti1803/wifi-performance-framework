# Wi-Fi Performance Testing & Automation Framework

## Project Overview
This is a **Python-based framework** to **test, monitor, and predict Wi-Fi network performance**.  
It automates latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss tests, provides a **live dashboard**, and includes a **machine learning model** to predict network degradation.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard
- Live plotting of Wi-Fi performance metrics using Matplotlib.
- Updates dynamically as tests run.

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction
- Random Forest Classifier predicts potential Wi-Fi degradation.
- Flags unusual latency spikes, bandwidth drops, or packet loss.
- Integrated with dashboard and PDF reports.

## Usage

- **Run the framework:**  <br>
Live Dashboard: Automatically shows performance metrics in real-time.<br>
ML Predictions: Alerts when network performance might degrade.<br>
PDF Reports: Saved in the reports/ folder after each test run.<br>
Why This Matters (For Hiring Managers):<br>
Demonstrates automated network testing and monitoring.<br>
Integrates ML for proactive performance alerts.<br>
Showcases Python automation, Wi-Fi networking, and data visualization skills.<br>
Highlights skills directly relevant to enterprise IT, cloud, and network infrastructure roles.<br>

ðŸ“Š Sample Output <br>
Live Dashboard: Shows throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss with red anomaly markers<br>
PDF Report: Summary table + plots with anomalies<br>
