## Project Overview
This is a **Python-based framework** to **test, monitor, and predict Wi-Fi network performance**.  
It automates latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss tests, provides a **live dashboard**, and includes a **machine learning model** to predict network degradation.

---

## Key Features
##Automated Wi-Fi Performance Testing

- Runs latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss tests.

- Supports different load conditions (e.g., multiple clients, bandwidth limits).

- Logs results in structured CSV files for later analysis.

##Real-Time Dashboard

- Live plotting of key metrics (latency, jitter, throughput, packet loss).

- Updates dynamically as tests run.

- Clear visualization for performance monitoring.

##Machine Learning Integration

- Random Forest Classifier trained on historical data.

- Predicts when Wi-Fi performance might degrade.

- Flags anomalies such as latency spikes, bandwidth drops, or packet loss.

- Integrated seamlessly with the live dashboard and test runs.

##Automated Reporting

- Generates professional PDF reports summarizing results.

- Includes graphs, test metrics, and ML predictions.

- Reports saved automatically in a reports/ folder.

##Anomaly Detection

- AI-based detection of unusual behavior (e.g., sudden jitter or packet loss).

- Highlights anomalies directly in reports.

##Extensible Framework

- Easy to add new metrics or test cases.

- Modular design for plugging in different ML models.

- Can scale from single laptop simulation to multi-client real tests.

##Scalability

- Uses iperf for traffic simulation (server & client modes).

- Supports multiple clients under different bandwidth/load conditions.

##Data Visualization

- CSV â†’ Graphs (Matplotlib).

- Real-time and static plotting.

- Easy to extend with advanced dashboards (e.g., Plotly/Streamlit in future).

##Automation & Scripting

- Python scripts handle test execution, logging, analysis, and visualization.

- Can be scheduled or run repeatedly without manual effort.

##Version Control & Collaboration

- Structured repository on GitHub.

- .gitignore configured to exclude large/generated files (CSV, cache, pickle).

##Why it matters for managers:

- In large-scale networks, Wi-Fi performance directly impacts user experience, productivity, and customer satisfaction. Manual testing is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

- This framework addresses those challenges by:

- Automating Wi-Fi testing â†’ reduces time, human error, and cost of validation

- Providing repeatable, data-driven benchmarks â†’ enables faster release cycles and higher confidence in deployments

- Supporting scalability â†’ adaptable for enterprise, IoT, and multi-device test environments

- Leveraging ML insights â†’ helps anticipate performance degradation before it impacts end users

For managers, this means faster go-to-market, improved reliability, and measurable performance assurance, all while aligning with Ciscoâ€™s mission of delivering secure, high-quality connectivity at scale.
