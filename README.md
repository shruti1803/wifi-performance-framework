## Project Overview
This is a **Python-based framework** to **test, monitor, and predict Wi-Fi network performance**.  
It automates latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss tests, provides a **live dashboard**, and includes a **machine learning model** to predict network degradation.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Dashboard
- Live plotting of Wi-Fi performance metrics using Matplotlib.
- Updates dynamically as tests run.

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction
- Random Forest Classifier predicts potential Wi-Fi degradation.
- Flags unusual latency spikes, bandwidth drops, or packet loss.
- Integrated with dashboard and PDF reports.

Why it matters for managers:

- In large-scale networks, Wi-Fi performance directly impacts user experience, productivity, and customer satisfaction. Manual testing is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

- This framework addresses those challenges by:

- Automating Wi-Fi testing â†’ reduces time, human error, and cost of validation

- Providing repeatable, data-driven benchmarks â†’ enables faster release cycles and higher confidence in deployments

- Supporting scalability â†’ adaptable for enterprise, IoT, and multi-device test environments

- Leveraging ML insights â†’ helps anticipate performance degradation before it impacts end users

For managers, this means faster go-to-market, improved reliability, and measurable performance assurance, all while aligning with Ciscoâ€™s mission of delivering secure, high-quality connectivity at scale.
